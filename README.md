This project started as a hobby project in 2022 with the goal of creating a personal website. It was originally built using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. Over time, the need for a more scalable and maintainable structure led to rebuilding the site using modern technologies like React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS.

This project has served as a learning experience in modern front-end development, with a focus on reusable components, responsive design, and clean UI/UX.
