# Personal Website Repository

I started this project in as a hobby in 2022, I wanted to keep an online presence through a website. It was developed using HTML, CSS initial. After a while tweaking many times in the website, I needed to manually update each components while using pure HTML, CSS, and little knowelege of JavaScript. Then I felt the urgency to learn a new stack React, to avoid the repetition of writing and copy pasting. This is how the website is React based at present.


## Technologies Used

The website is built using:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Illustrations**: Taken from Undraw.
- **Website Design**: Just made while taking inspiration from other websites.
- **Color Coding**: Primary Color is #3c77fc

## Website Structure

The website comprises several pages:

- **Home**: A page contains different sections as different components: Hero, About, Skills, Education, Experience, Projects, Contact.
- **Blog**: A page where I am fetching recently posted 10 blogs on my Medium of profile.
- **My Space**: A page, where I put my inspiration, and my favourite spotify playlist.
