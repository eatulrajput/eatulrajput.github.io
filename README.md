# Personal Website Repository

I began this project back in 2022 as a hobby, with the simple goal of establishing an online presence through a personal website. Initially, I built it using pure HTML and CSS, along with a bit of JavaScript. However, as I started to expand and maintain the site, I quickly ran into limitations — especially the repetitive work involved in managing similar sections across different pages. Every small update required manually editing multiple files, which was not scalable or efficient.

That experience pushed me to explore better solutions, and that’s when I discovered React. It allowed me to break my site into reusable components and manage content more cleanly, without duplication. Since then, my website has been rebuilt using the React + Vite stack and Tailwind CSS for styling. It’s not just a portfolio — it’s been a personal learning journey in web development, and I continue to improve it as I grow as a developer.


## Technologies Used

The website is built using:

- **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite**: A build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Illustrations**: Taken from Undraw.
- **Website Design**: Just made while taking inspiration from other websites.
- **Color Coding**: Primary Color is #3c77fc

## Website Structure

The website comprises several pages:

- **Home**: A page contains different sections as different components: Hero, About, Skills, Education, Experience, Projects, Contact.
- **Blog**: A page where I am fetching recently posted 10 blogs on my Medium of profile.
- **My Space**: A page, where I put my inspiration, and my favourite spotify playlist.
